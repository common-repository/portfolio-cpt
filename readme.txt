= How do I change the permalink on articles? =

In wp-admin, navigate to Settings -> Permalink Settings

Enter a value next to 'Portfolio'

Press 'Save Changes'.

= Shortcode Options =

The shortcode is extremely flexible. With no attributes set it will show all sections and articles:

`[portfolio]`

Adding a 'parent' attribute will limit the output to only sections that are within the parent you specify:

`[portfolio parent="29"]`

Another option is to set the order

`[portfolio orderby="id"]`
